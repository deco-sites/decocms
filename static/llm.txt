## deco CMS

deco is a **Context Management System** to help companies scale AI in production.
Value prop: **Build your context engine.**

### The pitch
**Your Context. Every AI.**
Stop rebuilding integrations for every AI tool.
Stop losing context when you switch between Claude and Cursor.
Stop letting vendors control your data.

Own your context. Run your mesh. Take it everywhere.

## What we're building

We're building the future where companies run AI-native internal software: business teams can solve problems without waiting on engineering cycles, and developers can compose complex systems from reusable building blocks.

This requires an MCP-first architecture: agents, tools, and workflows communicate through standard protocols instead of rigid APIs.

deco CMS has three layers:

1) **MCP Mesh** (Infrastructure) — gateway + runtime + control panel  
2) **MCP Studio** (Development) — no-code builder + full-code SDK  
3) **MCP App Store** (Consumption) — marketplace to discover, install, compose, and (soon) monetize

## Layer 1 — MCP Mesh (The Foundation)

Open-source MCP gateway where context engineers organize company-wide context.

### What it does
- **One endpoint for all MCP servers** (internal + external)
- **Connect & authenticate MCPs**
- **One-click install from the App Store**
- **Monitor & trace every tool call** (latency, errors, usage)
- **Control & budget** (rate limits, spend caps, cost attribution)
- **Smart routing** with policy enforcement
- **Code execution support** for major token reduction
- **AI gateway routing** or BYOK/BYOM
- **Centralized credentials vault**
- **Enterprise auth** (Okta / Azure AD / IdPs)
- **High performance** (designed for zero added latency)
- **Deploy anywhere** (self-host on Kubernetes or run on deco infra; no vendor lock-in)

### Who it's for
Enterprise AI Platform Teams (Platform Engineering / Enterprise IT) and Context Engineers who own SSO, access policies, audit trails, and safe rollout of MCP servers.

### Status
Launching **December 2025**: open-source, self-hosted gateway with observability + monitoring, plus an integrated App Store for one-click installs (small initial catalog). Wallet/sharing comes later.

## Layer 2 — MCP Studio (The Builder)

Full-stack framework for building MCP apps on the mesh — **no-code + full-code**.

Two modes that work together:
- **No-code vibecoding for business users:** chat-based app creation, templates, visual workflows, instant preview
- **Full-code for developers:** TypeScript-first SDK, agents, durable workflows, custom UIs, full observability through the mesh

Core idea: business users start fast; developers harden, scale, and extend.

## Layer 3 — MCP App Store (The Marketplace)

Catalog of packaged MCP-native solutions where users discover and install:
- **MCP Servers** (external connections like Slack / Drive / Salesforce, etc.)
- **MCP Apps** (packaged solutions: agents + workflows + UIs + databases)
- **Vertical bundles** (industry-specific packages)

Wallet-based monetization is part of the vision; initial launch focuses on a small catalog and one-click installs.

## Entry points (by maturity)
- **App Store:** start by installing pre-built apps
- **Studio:** start building custom apps
- **Mesh:** standardize + govern everything at scale
