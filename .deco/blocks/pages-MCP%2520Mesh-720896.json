          "question": "Will this lock us in?",
          "answer": "It's designed for the opposite: open-source, self-hosted, Kubernetes-native, deployable in your infrastructure. Your MCPs and clients stay portable, and you can audit or fork as needed."

        {
          "question": "Does it work with our existing AI tools?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How do you handle credentials and access?",
          "answer": "Credentials go into a centralized vault; access is enforced through enterprise auth and RBAC at the model/MCP/tool level, with policy checks before execution and audit trails for compliance."
