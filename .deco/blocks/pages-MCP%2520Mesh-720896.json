          "question": "Will this lock us in?",
          "answer": "It's designed for the opposite: open-source, self-hosted, Kubernetes-native, deployable in your infrastructure. Your MCPs and clients stay portable, and you can audit or fork as needed."

        {
          "question": "Does it work with our existing AI tools?",

        {
          "question": "How do you handle credentials and access?",
