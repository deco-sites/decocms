        {
          "question": "What exactly is an MCP \"Mesh\"?",
          "answer": "It's an infrastructure layer that acts as a central hub for all your MCP (Model Context Protocol) connections. Instead of connecting every agent directly to every tool (Slack, Github, Database), everyone connects to the Mesh, which manages authentication, permissions, and routing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does this replace Cursor or Claude Desktop?",
          "answer": "No! It empowers them. You connect Deco MCP Mesh to Cursor or Claude Desktop as if it were a single MCP server. This gives these clients instant and secure access to all tools configured in your organization."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I run it locally?",
          "answer": "Yes. Deco MCP Mesh was designed to be \"Local First\". With a single command, you spin up a full instance on your machine using SQLite, with no complex cloud configuration required."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is MCP Mesh just a glorified reverse proxy?",
          "answer": "No, MCP Mesh functions as a centralized Control Plane for your AI infrastructure rather than a simple reverse proxy. It decouples the consumer, such as an Agent or UI, from the provider or MCP Service to ensure credential isolation and protocol translation. The Mesh intercepts requests to enforce policies like RBAC and rate limits before they reach downstream services, while simultaneously injecting OpenTelemetry traces into every tool call for unified observability."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does authentication handle the \"principal problem\" across different services?",
          "answer": "We solve the principal identification challenge by implementing a dual-layer approach using Better Auth that supports OAuth 2.1, SAML, and API Keys. Instead of granting blanket access, the system utilizes resource-based permissions that map specific tools within a connection to allowable actions, such as enabling SEND_MESSAGE on a specific connection UUID."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I integrate this with my existing Identity Provider (Okta/Auth0)?",
          "answer": "You can integrate your existing Identity Provider because the architecture relies on the Better Auth Organization plugin to support comprehensive OAuth and SAML configurations. This setup enables you to map existing IdP groups directly to Mesh Roles, such as Admin or User, to automate access control across your MCP resources without reinventing identity management."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you handle secrets for downstream MCPs that require OAuth (e.g., Google/Slack)?",
          "answer": "The Mesh acts as an OAuth Client to downstream services by handling the entire authorization flow, including Dynamic Client Registration and PKCE. It securely stores refresh tokens in its encrypted vault so that when your Agent calls the Mesh, the system automatically injects the active downstream token into the proxy request without the Agent needing to manage the authentication complexity."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I self-host this in an air-gapped environment?",
          "answer": "You can deploy the Mesh in air-gapped environments as a standalone binary or Docker container because it requires no external dependencies other than the database, which defaults to an embedded SQLite file. All authentication configuration is handled via a local JSON file, making the system ideal for secure enclaves or Kubernetes setups where external connectivity is restricted."
