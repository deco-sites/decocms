        {
          "question": "Is this just another agent framework?",
          "answer": "No. Frameworks help you build agents. decoCMS is the operating layer that makes tool access, permissions, audit trails, and observability consistent—so agents can actually survive production."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do we need MCP to use this?",
          "answer": "If you're serious about interoperability, yes—MCP is quickly becoming the shared \"tool access protocol.\" decoCMS is built around MCP because governance and scale require a standard control plane."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does this help with \"shadow AI\"?",
          "answer": "By moving control from \"policy docs\" into runtime: SSO/IAM, access policies, audit logs, and cost attribution become enforced automatically instead of negotiated app-by-app."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do permissions work in practice?",
          "answer": "You define who can call what—by user/team/app/agent—at the Mesh layer. So \"marketing agent\" can read CRM fields but can't write to prod systems unless explicitly allowed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I self-host?",
          "answer": "Yes. The point is portability: run on Kubernetes, on-prem, or in your cloud—while keeping the same governed endpoint and operational model."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does this reduce cost, not increase it?",
          "answer": "Mesh-level runtime strategies help avoid \"tool spam\" and bloated contexts, route calls intelligently, and give you cost attribution per team/app—so you can actually set limits and optimize."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the fastest path to value?",
          "answer": "Start with one high-impact workflow where governance matters (support, sales ops, internal approvals). Use Mesh to standardize access + logging, then use Studio to turn what works into reusable assets."
