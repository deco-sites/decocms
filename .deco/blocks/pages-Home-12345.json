        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to be a developer to use DecoCMS?",
          "answer": "Not at all. Business teams can create prompts, workflows, and agents without writing code, while developers can extend, customize, and deploy advanced capabilities using our TypeScript SDK and CLI."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does DecoCMS handle governance and observability?",
          "answer": "Every run is fully traced, auditable, and secure. DecoCMS includes role-based access control (RBAC), spend caps, error analytics, and per-step cost visibility — ensuring safe operations and compliance by default."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I self-host DecoCMS or bring my own keys (BYOK)?",
          "answer": "Yes. DecoCMS is open-source and fully portable. You can self-host it on your infrastructure, bring your own API keys, and maintain full control over your data and costs."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I ensure my data stays private and secure when self-hosting DecoCMS?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. When you self-host DecoCMS, your data, models, and keys stay fully under your control. DecoCMS never stores or transmits your data unless you explicitly configure it to."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does DecoCMS cost?",
          "answer": "You start with $2 in free credits — no credit card required. After that, pricing is usage-based, so you only pay per run, with full transparency and real-time cost tracking in your dashboard."
