          "question": "What is deco CMS, and how is it different from other AI app builders?",
          "answer": "deco CMS is an open-source Context CMS — a control plane and runtime for building, running, and monetizing AI apps. Unlike traditional app builders, it unifies context, governance, observability, and monetization in one platform."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does deco CMS handle governance and observability?",
          "answer": "Every run is fully traced, auditable, and secure. DecoCMS includes role-based access control (RBAC), spend caps, error analytics, and per-step cost visibility — ensuring safe operations and compliance by default."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does the deco CMS SDK work for developers?",
          "answer": "The deco CMS SDK lets you build, extend, and manage agents, workflows, and UIs in TypeScript. It integrates seamlessly with the CLI, enabling local development, testing, and edge deployment from a single codebase."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the Context Mesh, and why is it important?",
          "answer": "The Context Mesh is DecoCMS’s governed layer for connecting data, tools, and models. It provides typed connectors with built-in policy routing, RBAC, observability, and spend controls — ensuring the right context is delivered safely every time."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does deco CMS support edge deployment?",
          "answer": "Yes. deco CMS ships agents, workflows, and UIs to the edge automatically, ensuring low latency and global performance by default. You can manage environments, preview builds, and deploy updates directly from the CLI."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does deco CMS integrate with Git?",
          "answer": "deco CMS uses a Git-backed workflow by default. Every change to agents, workflows, and UIs is versioned, allowing you to branch, review, and merge updates just like any modern development stack. This ensures full traceability and safe collaboration between teams."
