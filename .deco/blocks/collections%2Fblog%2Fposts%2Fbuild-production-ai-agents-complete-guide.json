    "content": "[{\"type\":\"heading\",\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Why Most AI Agents Never Reach Production\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Here's the uncomfortable truth: most AI agent projects die in the prototype phase. You've probably seen it happen. Someone builds a slick demo that wows the team, but six months later, it's still not handling real customer requests.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The problem isn't the technology. It's that building a cool agent and running one in production are completely different games.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"<strong>The prototype-to-production gap kills projects because:</strong>\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"First, there's the context problem. Your agent works great with toy examples, but real production data? That's messy, inconsistent, and way too large for most context windows. What worked in your notebook suddenly falls apart when users throw actual requests at it.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Then you've got the reliability nightmare. An agent that's right 80% of the time sounds decent until you realize that means one in five customer interactions goes sideways. In production, you need error handling, fallbacks, and graceful degradation. Your prototype probably has none of that.\"},{\"type\":\"callout\",\"title\":\"The 80/20 Rule Doesn't Apply Here\",\"content\":\"Getting an agent to 80% accuracy takes 20% of the effort. Getting it production-ready takes the other 80%. Plan accordingly.\",\"variant\":\"warning\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And let's talk about observability. When your agent makes a bad decision, can you figure out why? Most teams can't. They're flying blind, unable to debug which tool call went wrong or why the LLM chose that particular action. Without proper logging and tracing, you're just hoping things work.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Cost is another silent killer. That agent burning through GPT-4 calls might cost pennies in testing, but scale it to thousands of users and suddenly you're explaining a five-figure monthly bill to finance.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The final nail? Integration complexity. Your agent needs to talk to your database, your CRM, your internal APIs. Each integration is another point of failure, another security review, another deployment dependency. The simple architecture that worked locally becomes a distributed systems nightmare.\"},{\"type\":\"heading\",\"level\":2,\"text\":\"Scaling Your AI Agent Infrastructure\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So you've got one agent working. Congrats! Now multiply that by ten agents, a hundred users, and twenty different data sources. Welcome to the scaling challenge.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Scaling isn't just about handling more requests. It's about maintaining consistency, managing costs, and keeping your sanity when things inevitably break.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"<strong>The infrastructure challenges hit you in waves:</strong>\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Performance becomes critical fast. A single agent that takes 10 seconds to respond? Users might tolerate it. But when you're orchestrating multiple agents, those delays compound. Suddenly a simple workflow takes two minutes, and your users are already gone.\"},{\"type\":\"stats\",\"stats\":[{\"number\":\"3 seconds\",\"label\":\"Maximum acceptable response time for production agents\"},{\"number\":\"10x\",\"label\":\"Cost increase without proper caching and optimization\"},{\"number\":\"47%\",\"label\":\"Reduction in agent failures with proper observability\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You need a real orchestration strategy. How do agents communicate? How do you prevent circular dependencies? What happens when Agent A needs data from Agent B, but Agent B is waiting on Agent C? Without proper workflow management, you're building a distributed deadlock generator.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The MCP (Model Context Protocol) approach changes this game completely. Instead of hardcoding integrations and hoping for the best, you build a mesh of composable context servers. Each server handles one domain well. Your agents consume context through a standardized interface.\"},{\"type\":\"code\",\"code\":\"// MCP-native agent setup\\nconst agent = createAgent({\\n  model: \\\"gpt-4\\\",\\n  context: [\\n    mcpServer(\\\"customer-data\\\"),\\n    mcpServer(\\\"product-catalog\\\"),\\n    mcpServer(\\\"order-history\\\")\\n  ],\\n  tools: [searchProducts, createOrder, sendNotification]\\n});\",\"language\":\"typescript\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"This isn't just cleaner code. It's a fundamentally different architecture that actually scales. When you need to add a new data source, you spin up a new MCP server. Your agents don't change. When you need to update how customer data works, you modify one server. All agents benefit immediately.\"},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But here's what really matters for scaling: governance. You need centralized policy enforcement. Which models can access what data? What's the rate limit per user? How do you handle PII? Answer these questions at the platform level, not per-agent.\"},{\"type\":\"heroBox\",\"title\":\"Ready to Build Production-Grade AI Agents?\",\"content\":\"DecoCMS gives you the MCP-native framework, TypeScript-first development, and enterprise governance to go from prototype to production fast.\",\"variant\":\"primary\",\"buttons\":[{\"text\":\"Start Building Today\",\"href\":\"https://admin.decocms.com/login\",\"variant\":\"primary\"}]}]",
